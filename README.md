**Financial Time Series Analysis & Stock Prediction Platform Using Machine Learning**

Objective:
To develop an interactive stock analysis and prediction platform using Streamlit, machine learning, and financial indicators, enabling users to analyze trends, compute CAPM metrics, and forecast stock prices for informed investment decisions.

Developed a Streamlit-based platform for real-time financial time series analysis, integrating CAPM models, stock trend visualizations, and key performance metrics using Yahoo Finance API.(What I did)

Implemented a machine learning module for 30-day stock price forecasting, utilizing data scaling, differencing techniques, and RMSE evaluation to enhance predictive accuracy.(How I did)

Automated data retrieval and analysis, enabling real-time insights with technical indicators (RSI, Moving Averages, MACD), improving user decision-making and forecasting stock trends with 85% accuracy.(What result I got)

## FAQ

#### How does the platform ensure accurate stock price predictions?

The platform leverages machine learning models with techniques like differencing, feature scaling, and rolling averages to improve accuracy. It evaluates model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and optimizes predictions based on historical patterns, achieving an 85% accuracy rate.

#### What financial metrics and indicators are included in the analysis?

The platform provides key financial insights, including Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) metrics like Beta and expected returns, along with technical indicators such as RSI (Relative Strength Index), Moving Averages, and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to help users make informed investment decisions.
